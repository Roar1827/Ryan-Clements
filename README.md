## About Me

I am an entrepreneur with a passion for learning and I thrive in a team environment. I am passionate about the management of software teams. Many great minds have been left perplexed trying to create a productive and happy software development team. I am constantly looking for examples of what works, as well as what doesn't. Currently I am making mobile games with [The Farm Ventures.](http://www.thefarmventures.com) I am always reading. [(More about me...)](aboutme.md)
