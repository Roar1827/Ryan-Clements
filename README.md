It is truly incredible how far we have come. It has been almost five years now since we began a transformation at Innovasium which would prove to impact every area of the business. 

Perhaps the most exciting result of this is the amazing things we have been able to accomplish in our community. As Advance began to grow, we realized how much benefit local charities and non-profits could gain from this software. Most of these companies and charities could never afford to have a custom web application built for them, and open sourced alternatives only provide such a small percentage of the functionality they need. Used to create donation forms, volunteer scheduling and resourcing, and even project management, Advance has changed the way so many charities are able to interact with the community. And best of all, we are able to provide this for them completely free of charge. We are able to offer training and support as well, as charities build their own solutions using Advance. This is something that we are all very proud of.

Our company culture has grown so much in the past five years, it is truly remarkable. As the way we approached our work began to change, we saw team-work flourish in the office. [(Continue Reading...)](2021.md)

### **Joy, Inc.** How We Built a Workplace People Love *(Richard Sheridan)*

#### Reaction:
Richard Sheridan has challenged almost everything that I thought "has to be this way" in the software development world. He has inspired me to want what he has created at Menlo for my own team. After reading this book I am no longer content with minor improvements made over long periods of time. I am convinced there is a better way, and it is within reach for all who are willing to take the steps towards finding it.
#### Favourite Quotes:
- <sub>"In most companies, clients are ushered through a cube farm to a closed-door conference room where big decisions are made in private. These closed meeting rooms send a powerful message: if you're on the wrong side of the door, you don't have the authority to participate in this discussion. It says, 'You don't matter as much as I do.'" (Page 43)</sub>
- <sub>"In my earliest moments of contemplating paired work... I had to fight every one of my managerial instincts. This was an incredibly inefficient way to organize humans, right? Isn't it more productive to have each person work separately? Aren't we paying two people to do one job? What I have learned is that pairing is one of the most potent managerial tools I have ever discovered because of all the traditional problems it helps solve. Pairing fosters a learning system, builds relationships, eliminates towers of knowledge, simplifies onboarding of new people, and flushes out performance issues." (Page 50)</sub>
- <sub>"Working in pairs doesn't mean that one person gets to slack off while another is glued to the keyboard. People who have just joined us leave at the end of an eight-hour day looking quite exhausted. When I ask them how their day was, they often say that they had a great day... but they are really tired. It's not that they've logged more hours at their desks at Menlo- it's just that they probably never worked even close to eight productive hours in an eight-hour day. (Page 53)</sub>
- <sub>*On why Menlo uses paper based project management tools:* "Uncomplicated tools that are easy to learn invite wider participation by all stakeholders." (Page 119)</sub>
- <sub>"Most organizations give lip service to 'Fail fast.' During early experiments when a team is testing their limits, it doesn't take much to crush their spirit, and then, suddenly, experiments become all about *being safe*, not taking small risks. In a *being safe* culture, people choose to run safe experiments that they know will succeed, effectively exhausting the energy behind a change initiative. This kind of practice is deadly to innovation." (Page 124)</sub>
 

### **Scrum** The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time *(Jeff Sutherland)*

#### Reaction:
There is an incredible amount of value to be found in this book. Although I don't believe this implementation of an Agile framework is a direct fit for all, Jeff will at least challenge you to question why you do things the way you do. 
#### Favourite Quotes:
- <sub>"Time makes up your life, so wasting it is actually a slow form of suicide. (Page 81)</sub>
- <sub>"He started telling people that working late wasn't a sign of commitment; it was a sign of failure. 'It's not because I want you to have a balanced life,' he told people. 'It's because you'll get more stuff done.'" (Page 102)</sub>
- <sub>"The most important part of Scrum: it changes the culture people work in, which can be scary for some." (Page 143)</sub>
- <sub>"One of the key concepts in Scrum is that the team members decide themselves how they're going to do the work. It's management's responsibility to set the strategic goals, but it's the team's job to decide how to reach those goals." (Page 50)</sub>


### **Notes to a Software Team Leader** Growing Self Organizing Teams *(Roy Osherove)*

#### Reaction:
If you are looking for a polished book on software team leadership, this book is not what you want. If however, you are looking for valuable insight dispensed in a clear and concise manner then you will want to order this immediately. 
#### Favourite Quotes:
- <sub>"One thing all [performance reviews] have in common is that they focus on the individual, their performance, and what they've accomplished since the last review period. They encourage the individual to take credit for themselves and to compete against the other people on their team for recognition and a limited pot of money when it comes to bonuses and salary increases. I would suggest that this is in direct conflict with the adoption and use of agile frameworks within the organization." - Gary Reynolds (Appendix 14)
- <sub>"Set a rule whereby no one is allowed to work on something on their own for more than a day." (Page 5)</sub>
- <sub>"I define survival as your team not having enough time to learn." (Page 21)</sub>
- <sub>"It is very likely that letting [your team] self-organize without learning the proper skills is partly the reason why you're in survival mode today." (Page 43)</sub>
- <sub>"If you ask your team to work long hours, you should be the last to leave during survival mode." (Page 47)</sub>
- <sub>"Ask yourself, on a weekly or daily basis 'Is my team better than it was last week?'" (Page 93)</sub>
- <sub>"If the only feedback you offer is negative and corrective, it is likely to dampen anyone's spirits, independently of whether or not it is factually correct. Negative feedback is likely to breed mistrust and resentment. It is disempowering and demotivating. The absence of any positive feedback, by implication, suggests that there is nothing the person is doing right." (Page 123)</sub>
- <sub>"As a rule of thumb, when you step back and look at the problem you are facing, chances are the real issue is not a technical one; it's probably a nonrational, subconscious soul-fart, that is bubbling around inside somewhere, masking as a technical problem."- Bill Walters (Appendix 11)</sub>
- <sub>"Will my developers be better in a month or two than they were before? If not, how do I make that happen?" - Cory Foy (Appendix 15)</sub>
- <sub>"If you do not know anything about human behaviour, you know very little about software development." - Jose Ramon Diaz (Appendix 17</sub>
- <sub>"Leadership (whether from within or without) takes the team to places it would otherwise never have reached, perhaps never even considered." - Mike Burrows (Appendix 18)</sub>
- <sub>"Ideas for change should be coming from within the team as well as from you. They will come from reflectionon what's not right and inspiration from what other teams are doing. Encourage the team to network at user groups, read blogs and use Twitter, and so on. These resources can make a huge difference to a team's enthusiasm for change." - Tom Howlett (Appendix 26)</sub>
