It is truly incredible how far we have come. It has been almost five years now since we began a transformation at Innovasium which would prove to impact every area of the business. 

Perhaps the most exciting result of this is the amazing things we have been able to accomplish in our community. As Advance began to grow, we realized how much benefit local charities and non-profits could gain from this software. Most of these companies and charities could never afford to have a custom web application built for them, and open sourced alternatives only provide such a small percentage of the functionality they need. Used to create donation forms, volunteer scheduling and resourcing, and even project management, Advance has changed the way so many charities are able to interact with the community. And best of all, we are able to provide this for them completely free of charge. We are able to offer training and support as well, as charities build their own solutions using Advance. This is something that we are all very proud of.

Our company culture has grown so much in the past five years, it is truly remarkable. As the way we approached our work began to change, we saw team-work flourish in the office. [(Continue Reading...)](2021.md)

### Books

**Joy, Inc.** How We Built a Workplace People Love *(Richard Sheridan)*

#### Reaction:
Richard Sheridan has challenged almost everything that I thought "has to be this way" in the software development world. He has inspired me to want what he has created at Menlo for my own team. After reading this book I am no longer content with minor improvements made over long periods of time. I am convinced there is a better way, and it is within reach for all who are willing to take the steps towards finding it.
#### Favourite Quotes:
- <sub>"In most companies, clients are ushered through a cube farm to a closed-door conference room where big decisions are made in private. These closed meeting rooms send a powerful message: if you're on the wrong side of the door, you don't have the authority to participate in this discussion. It says, 'You don't matter as much as I do.'" (Page 43)</sub>
- <sub>"In my earliest moments of contemplating paired work... I had to fight every one of my managerial instincts. This was an incredibly inefficient way to organize humans, right? Isn't it more productive to have each person work separately? Aren't we paying two people to do one job? What I have learned is that pairing is one of the most potent managerial tools I have ever discovered because of all the traditional problems it helps solve. Pairing fosters a learning system, builds relationships, eliminates towers of knowledge, simplifies onboarding of new people, and flushes out performance issues." (Page 50)</sub>
- <sub>"Working in pairs doesn't mean that one person gets to slack off while another is glued to the keyboard. People who have just joined us leave at the end of an eight-hour day looking quite exhausted. When I ask them how their day was, they often say that they had a great day... but they are really tired. It's not that they've logged more hours at their desks at Menlo- it's just that they probably never worked even close to eight productive hours in an eight-hour day. (Page 53)</sub>
- <sub>*On why Menlo uses paper based project management tools:* "Uncomplicated tools that are easy to learn invite wider participation by all stakeholders." (Page 119)</sub>
- <sub>Most organizations give lip service to "Fail fast." During early experiments when a team is testing their limits, it doesn't take much to crush their spirit, and then, suddenly, experiments become all about *being safe*, not taking small risks. In a *being safe* culture, people choose to run safe experiments that they know will succeed, effectively exhausting the energy behind a change initiative. This kind of practice is deadly to innovation." (Page 124)</sub>
