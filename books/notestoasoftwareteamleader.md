#### Favourite Quotes:
- <sub>"One thing all [performance reviews] have in common is that they focus on the individual, their performance, and what they've accomplished since the last review period. They encourage the individual to take credit for themselves and to compete against the other people on their team for recognition and a limited pot of money when it comes to bonuses and salary increases. I would suggest that this is in direct conflict with the adoption and use of agile frameworks within the organization." - Gary Reynolds (Appendix 14)
- <sub>"Set a rule whereby no one is allowed to work on something on their own for more than a day." (Page 5)</sub>
- <sub>"I define survival as your team not having enough time to learn." (Page 21)</sub>
- <sub>"It is very likely that letting [your team] self-organize without learning the proper skills is partly the reason why you're in survival mode today." (Page 43)</sub>
- <sub>"If you ask your team to work long hours, you should be the last to leave during survival mode." (Page 47)</sub>
- <sub>"Ask yourself, on a weekly or daily basis 'Is my team better than it was last week?'" (Page 93)</sub>
- <sub>"If the only feedback you offer is negative and corrective, it is likely to dampen anyone's spirits, independently of whether or not it is factually correct. Negative feedback is likely to breed mistrust and resentment. It is disempowering and demotivating. The absence of any positive feedback, by implication, suggests that there is nothing the person is doing right." (Page 123)</sub>
- <sub>"As a rule of thumb, when you step back and look at the problem you are facing, chances are the real issue is not a technical one; it's probably a nonrational, subconscious soul-fart, that is bubbling around inside somewhere, masking as a technical problem."- Bill Walters (Appendix 11)</sub>
- <sub>"Will my developers be better in a month or two than they were before? If not, how do I make that happen?" - Cory Foy (Appendix 15)</sub>
- <sub>"If you do not know anything about human behaviour, you know very little about software development." - Jose Ramon Diaz (Appendix 17</sub>
- <sub>"Leadership (whether from within or without) takes the team to places it would otherwise never have reached, perhaps never even considered." - Mike Burrows (Appendix 18)</sub>
- <sub>"Ideas for change should be coming from within the team as well as from you. They will come from reflectionon what's not right and inspiration from what other teams are doing. Encourage the team to network at user groups, read blogs and use Twitter, and so on. These resources can make a huge difference to a team's enthusiasm for change." - Tom Howlett (Appendix 26)</sub>
