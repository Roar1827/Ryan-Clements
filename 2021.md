It is truly incredible how far we have come. It has been almost five years now since we began a transformation at Innovasium which would prove to impact every area of the business. 

Perhaps the most exciting part is the amazing things we have been able to accomplish in our community. As Advance began to grow, we realized how much benefit local charities and non-profits could gain from this software. Most of these companies and charities could never afford to have a custom web application built for them, and open sourced alternatives only provide such a small percentage of the functionality they need. Used to create donation forms, volunteer scheduling and resourcing, and even project management, Advance has changed the way so many charities are able to interact with the community. And best of all, we are able to provide this for them completely free of charge. We are able to offer training and support as well, as charities build their own solutions using Advance.

Our company culture has grown so much in the past five years, I can only describe it as remarkable. As the way we approached our work began to change, we saw team-work flourish in the office. Not only is our team happier, but we are more productive than ever before. We have completely eliminated any "towers of knowledge" that had built up over the years, and have seen such joy in the freedom this has provided. Now unrestricted by the chains that come with being the only person to know the details of a particular piece of software, we are able to shift people around as they learn new skills and develop new passions.

Our development team is so proud of the software we ship each and every day. Technical debt used to weigh on all of us, as we wondered how long the calm would last before the next "fire" came. Sure, we still have issues to solve, but since the team is no longer in "survival mode" we never have to face a challenge alone. Since we began finishing work prior to deadlines, we have had the ability to truly be agile, working as a team to make sure no one (or no project) is left behind. The quality of our code can't be attributed to an individual change, but rather a combination of many contributing ones. First, our dedication to automated testing, has drastically reduced the number of bugs that make their way into our code. It also allows us to refactor our code with confidence, keeping it simple for others to understand and build on in the future. Second, our paired approach to programming keeps us from cutting corners or making "obvious" mistakes.
